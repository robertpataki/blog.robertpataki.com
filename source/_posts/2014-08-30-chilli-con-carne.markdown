<p class="post-intro">I remember my mum's finest chilli con carne recipe from when I was little. It had loads of minced beef in it, and we used to have it with fresh bread and sour cream - we're Hungarian after all. This is the kind of meal you always have seconds of.</p>

This is one of those recipes I learnt from my mum but through the years I have sligthly altered it - especially since I have been a vegan. Claire keeps telling me this is still my best recipe, so here it is: I'll reveal my secret and show you how to cook a fine vegan chilli con carne!

## Time required

**Preparation:**	 	10 minutes	
**Cooking:**	 		30 minutes

## Ingredients (for 2)

* 1 medium size onion
* 2 large gloves of garlic
* 90 grams of soya mince
* 1/4 tbsp paprika powder
* 1 (~400g) tin of chopped tomatoes
* 1 (~400g)tin of canellini beans

3. Slice up the chilli

## Cooking

1. Once the mince is ready place a large saucepan on medium heat (4/10 on electric cooker), add the coconut oil, the onion and the garlic. Add some salt, so that the onion won't burn and stir frequently until the onions are slightly translucent and soft.
2. Once the onion is ready add the soya mince and a bit of water and turn up the heat a bit (7/10 on electric cooker) to bring it to boil.
3. When the contents are boiling add the beans, the sweetcorn, the seasoning, and the chillies. Give it a good stir and cover it up with a lid.
4. Cook for about 30 minutes, stir occasionally to make sure it's not sticking and it is cooking nicely.
5. Once done with the cooking, remove it from the hot hob, uncover it, and let it cool for a while.

## Serving

I usually serve my chilli with fresh sour dough bread and a bit of Sojade.
