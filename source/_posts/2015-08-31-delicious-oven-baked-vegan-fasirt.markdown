<p class="post-intro">Hungarian fasirt is traditionally made using minced beef or pork, and deep fried in a lot of vegetable oil - very tasty but not so healthy, nor it is vegan :) The recipe below is a vegan alternative to this delicious bite-sized phenomena.</p>

As opposed to deep frying I prefer using less (or even no oil at all) and oven bake the fasirt patties instead, but feel free to experiment with the recipe and see which method you prefer more.

## Time required

**Preparation:**	 	40 minutes	
**Cooking:**	 		25 minutes

## Ingredients (for 3)

* 1/2 onion
* 150 grams of soya mince
* Oat flakes
* Olive oil
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1 medium carrot
* A small bunch of fresh parsley
* Sea salt, ground black pepper, dried marjoram, red paprika, dried coriander

## Preparation

* Put the soya mince into a large bowl and cover it with water, let it soak it all up
* Chop up the onion into very fine dices
* Grate the carrot finely
* Chop the parsley very finely
* Add the seasoning to taste
* Add a tiny bit of olive oil
* Add a handful of oat flakes
* Crush the garlic and add it to the bowl
* Once the soya mince soaked up the water, add all the ingredients to the bowl and mix it well together

## Shaping the patties

To make the fasirt mixture nice and consistent, you will have to keep balancing the amount of olive oil and oat flakes you're adding to the mix (too much oil will make it too moist, too much oats will make it too dry and will make the patties fall apart). This is important, as you don't want your patties to fall apart.

Once your mixture is ready, you should be able to form little balls, which won't fall apart as you shape them. Place your patties on a tin foiled plate and put them in the fridge to chill for ~30 minutes.

## Cooking

* Take the patties out the fridge
* Heat up the oven to ~220Â°C
* Place the patties into an over dish and leave them in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until they get golden brown.

You can serve the patties with virtually any sides - rice, cooked or mashed potatoes, or some fresh bread :)

Enjoy!
