<p class="post-intro">The other day I was searching for some cooking inspiration, and I stumbled upon a very nice <a class="link" href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2008/08/roasted-eggplant-almond-dip.html" target="_blank">vegan recipe</a>. After making that delicious dip myself I started thinking how I could turn it into a mushroom stuffing, so I started experimenting, and I replaced the aubergines with courgettes, and I did some minor alterations to the original recipe. I was quite happy with the result, so I thought I'd share this tasty vegan creation with others.</p>


## Ingredients (for 4)

   * 4 portobello mushrooms
   * 1 cup of brown rice
   * 1/2 table spoon of coconut fat (or olive oil)

## Ingredients for the sauce

   * 2 medium sized courgettes
   * 4 gloves of garlic
   * 1 medium sized onion
   * 1 small slice of ginger
   * 1/4 cup of mustard seeds
   * 1/4 cup of almonds
   * 3/4 cube of vegetable stock
   * 1 red pepper
   * 1 table spoon of co-yo or soya yoghurt
   * salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper to taste

## Preparation and cooking

  1. Put the almond and the mustard seeds in a medium sized cooking pan and toast them slightly until the mustard seeds start to pop. Once they are done put them in the blender bowl.

  2. On a low-ish heat cook the diced up onions and garlic (diced and crushed as well), and once the onion is becoming see-through, add 1/4 cup of water and the diced up corgettes and the pepper. Cook it for about 10 minutes on low heat, then add the vegetable stock, pepper and salt to taste.

  3. Once the corgettes are cooked, take them off the heat and put them in the blender bowl. Add the co-yo (or soya yoghurt) and the ginger and blend it until it is nice and smooth. If it is too watery add some more almonds. If it's too solid, add some more co-yo.

  4. Scoop the sauce onto each mushroom carefully, and place the mushrooms in a medium sized cooking dish (put some coconut fat at the bottom, so that the mushrooms won't stick). Once all mushrooms are comfortably covered with the sauce, place a few slices of fresh garlic on top of them. Place the dish in a preheated oven (425F or 230C) and cook for 30 minutes. Every 10 minutes check on the oven and move the mushrooms a bit around to make sure they don't stick to the bottom.

  5. Place the rice in a medium sized pan on medium heat. Once the rice starts sizzling, pour water on it and bring to boil. Once boiling, add some salt, stir and cover the pan, and bring the heat down to minimum. After all the water is gone, bring off the heat and uncover.

## Serving

You can serve the meal with some fresh slices of cucumbers, parsley and tomatoes.

## Using the leftover dip

The leftover dip is perfect to be used as spread on some fresh bread! Put it on a slice of fresh sourdough bread with a pinch of salt and some chillies and enjoy it for breakfast the next morning :)
